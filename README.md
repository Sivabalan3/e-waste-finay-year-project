# A Blockchain-Based IoT-Enabled E-Waste Tracking and Tracing System for Smart Cities

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) enabled system for tracking and tracing electronic waste (e-waste) in smart cities. The system leverages the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology, along with the connectivity of IoT devices, to provide a reliable and efficient solution for e-waste management.

## Features
- **IoT Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with IoT devices for real-time tracking of e-waste.
- **Blockchain Technology**: Utilizes blockchain for secure and transparent record-keeping.
- **E-Waste Tracking**: Tracks the lifecycle of electronic products to manage e-waste effectively.
- **Smart City Compatibility**: Designed with smart cities in mind for efficient waste management.
